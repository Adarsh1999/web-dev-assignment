Simple Calculator Web Application
This is a simple calculator web application built using JQuery and Arrow Function. The application consists of two pages. On the first page, there are three fields: Email, User Name, and Password. These fields are validated properly, including Null checks, Special Characters Check, Length Checks, etc. Specific error messages are displayed for each validation error. The Email field only accepts northeastern mail ids.

If the validations are successful, the application will redirect to the second page. The second page displays the logged-in user's name and has two text fields for user input. There are four buttons for the four basic arithmetic operations: "Add", "Subtract", "Multiply", and "Divide". On clicking the respective button, the appropriate result is displayed in a label or text field. The result is not editable.

Both text fields on the second page are also validated, allowing only numbers. All four arithmetic operations are performed using only one Arrow Function.

      <p class="about-subtext">
        Spider-Man: No Way Home is a 2021 American superhero film based on the
        Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and
        Marvel Studios and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the
        sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home
        (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The
        film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik
        Sommers. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside
        Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx,
        Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei,
        Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen
        Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a
        secret again following its public revelation at the end of Far From
        Home. When the spell goes wrong because of Parker's actions, the
        multiverse is broken open, which allows visitors from alternate
        realities to enter Parker's universe.
